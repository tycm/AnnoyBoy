#AnnoyBoy
When looking for discord bots, I noticed there was not one that had everything I wanted in the way that I wanted. So I decided to make my own. 

## Usage
Make sure to create a 'config.json' file in the root of the project following the template of

```
{
	"prefix": "~",
	"token": "discord token here",
	"ytapi": "youtube api token here"
}
```

To host this yourself clone the respository and install all of the dependencies by issuing
```
npm install
```

Then the bot can be run by issuing
```
node AnnoyBoy.js
```

## Credits
This couldn't be done without [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)
